# Photoresistor-Experiments
This repository keeps a track of my development of practical applications of a Photoresistor
Light intensity sensors can be very costly for which I tried using inexpensive photoresistors to create this system.
The repository will also contain the csv files and few testing programs which I used to study the behavour of the Photoresistor under different conditions
